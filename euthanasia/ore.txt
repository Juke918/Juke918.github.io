Oregon:


Oregon’s Death With Dignity Act added a lot of stipulations to patients accessing PAS. Some of these stipulations definitely
disenfranchise poor people and people of color. The DWDA contains “requirements for physician consultations and referrals 
for patients considering PAS” that would make it economically infeasible for a lot of patients. Additionally, “In the case
that either physician believes the patient’s judgement may be impaired by a psychiatric or psychological disorder, the 
patient must be referred for psychological evaluation to confirm that the patient has sound judgement”. The vagueness of 
the term “patient’s judgement may be impaired” leaves it subject to a lot of bias. And it is well documented that 
physicians hold a lot of bias against poor people and POC. Not only does this unfairly add more cost into the process but
it could also completely inhibit patients from accessing PAS.
