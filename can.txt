Canada:


A study on the economic effects of legalizing PAS in Canada yielded some interesting results. It suggested that legalizing PAS 
would, at worst, be net neutral for the health care system, and, at best, net the system $138.8 million. However, much of the 
study was theoretical and did not focus on the effects for each individual. Additionally, Canada implements a far mor blanket 
healthcare system than Massachusetts so it is not clear whether it would be feasible to implement a similar PAS system under our 
current healthcare system.
