California:


California has had major issues with the lethal injection drug it uses, Seconal. In 2009, the lethal dose cost less than $200.
Then, “over the next six years, it shot up to $1,500, according to drug price databases Medi-Span and First Databank”. In 
February 2016, Valeant, a pharmaceutical company, bought the the manufacturer of Seconal and immediately doubled the price to
$3000. People without health insurance are already disenfranchised and these procedures implemented by Valeant only 
disenfranchises them more. There is a $400 cocktail of drugs patients can opt to take however this gives an immensely less 
comfortable death to the patient.
