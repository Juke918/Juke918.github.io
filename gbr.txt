Great Britain


Although PAS and PAD are illegal in Great Britain, citizens are allowed to undergo PAS in Switzerland. However, this system 
leads to a lot of economic hindrances. Only 25% of people (in Britain) would be able to afford to have an assisted death in 
Switzerland. Many people are actually forced to fundraise despite it being against the law. There are a lot of costs that 
you might not think of at first. For example, most people opt to buy a return plane ticket just in case they change their 
mind. Additionally, staying at a hotel that accommodates the patient’s medical needs can be very expensive. There is also a 
class advantage to the system as filling out all the necessary paperwork and following the due process can be very 
unintuitive to someone who has not lived a “well-off life”. To quote one Brit, “The first thing I’d like to say here is that
this is a class thing. I’m middle-class, Bob was a working-class bloke. I know my way around the system, he wasn’t confident, 
he found it frustrating and instead of getting things done, he just got frustrated and angry with it. I’m afraid you have to
smooth your way around, it’s not very pleasant but it has to be done.”
